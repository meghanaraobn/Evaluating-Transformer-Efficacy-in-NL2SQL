## Abstract

- We studied automated natural language to SQL translators (NL2SQL) considering the state-of-the-art on transformer-based models.
- We experiment with, variations (hyper-paramters) and extensions (e.g. alternative transformer usage) for this task and existing models, comparing our results with baselines and alternatives.
- We conducted experiment to see how the fine tuning on the transformers improve the performance of NL2SQL models.
- Language models such as Distil-BERT, T5 and GPT2 are used.
- Evaluation is reported for CoSQL dataset as it consists multi turn interaction and complex queries that mimics real world NL2SQL assistants.
- We study  NL2SQL models - EditSQL, R2SQL, GAZP.
- We used Exact Match evaluation metric.
